## 🔄 Next Steps for Production Deployment

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy and configure production environment files
cp .env.production .env.prod
cp backend/.env.production backend/.env.prod

# Update with your actual values:
# - Database passwords
# - API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
# - Domain names
# - Security secrets
```

### 2. Infrastructure Preparation
- [ ] Set up production server/cloud infrastructure
- [ ] Configure domain names and SSL certificates
- [ ] Set up external databases (if not using Docker containers)
- [ ] Configure backup storage
- [ ] Set up monitoring infrastructure

### 3. Security Configuration
- [ ] Generate strong, unique passwords for all services
- [ ] Set up proper firewall rules
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Set up VPN access for administrative tasks
- [ ] Configure log retention and rotation

### 4. Database Setup
- [ ] Initialize production databases
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure database monitoring

### 5. Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Start monitoring stack
cd monitoring
docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d

# Access monitoring dashboards:
# Grafana: http://your-domain:3001
# Prometheus: http://your-domain:9090
# AlertManager: http://your-domain:9093
```

### 6. Deployment
```bash
# Make deployment script executable
chmod +x scripts/deploy-production.sh

# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy-production.sh deploy

# Check deployment status
./scripts/deploy-production.sh status

# Monitor health
./scripts/deploy-production.sh health
```

## 🔍 Production Validation

### Health Checks
After deployment, verify all health endpoints:

```bash
# Basic health check
curl http://your-domain:8000/health

# Detailed health check
curl http://your-domain:8000/api/v1/health/detailed

# Frontend health check
curl http://your-domain:3000/api/health

# Kubernetes probes
curl http://your-domain:8000/api/v1/health/readiness
curl http://your-domain:8000/api/v1/health/liveness
```

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Load testing with realistic user scenarios
- [ ] Database performance under load
- [ ] API response time validation
- [ ] File upload/processing performance

### Security Testing
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] SSL/TLS configuration validation
- [ ] Authentication and authorization testing

## 📈 Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Application Health**: Response times, error rates, uptime
- **Infrastructure**: CPU, memory, disk usage, network
- **Database**: Connection counts, query performance, replication lag
- **Business Metrics**: User registrations, document uploads, API usage

### Alert Thresholds
- **Critical**: Service down, database unavailable, high error rate (>5%)
- **Warning**: High response time (>2s), high resource usage (>80%)
- **Info**: Deployment events, configuration changes

## 🔄 Backup & Recovery

### Automated Backups
- Database backups (daily, retained for 30 days)
- File uploads backup (daily, retained for 30 days)
- Configuration backup (on changes)

### Recovery Procedures
- Database restore from backup
- Application rollback to previous version
- Infrastructure recovery from disaster
